### About
- This is a hero database.
- the collection of Heroes spans the multiverse whether it be Iron man, Bat man, or even Ben 10
- This database has two pages one is the home page and the other is the hero page
- I am pulling from an api and appending the page
- you can look up different heroes and the result will be a card.
### possible Issues
- some Heroes like A-Bomb have a dash in their name so if it doesn't work the first time try adding a dash to their name.
- also if the hero has two words in the name capitalize the first letter of both heroes.
